# Face Recognition with SVM and Ensemble Methods  

## Overview  

This project aims to recognize faces using the Olivetti Faces dataset from the sklearn package. It employs various machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) for initial classification and two ensemble methods, Random Forest and AdaBoost. The goal is to demonstrate how ensemble methods can enhance model accuracy and robustness in image classification tasks.  

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project is the Olivetti Faces dataset, which contains images of faces with associated labels. Key characteristics of the dataset include:  

- 400 grayscale images of faces  
- Each image is 64x64 pixels  
- 40 different subjects (each subject has 10 images)  

## Requirements  

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:  

- numpy   
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib 

You can install the necessary packages using pip:  

```bash  
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
