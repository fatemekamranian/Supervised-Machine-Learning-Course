# Movie Review Gross Estimation using Gradient Descent Regression  

## Overview  

This project involves building and training a gradient descent-based regression model to estimate the gross revenue of movies using a dataset containing movie reviews and various features. The primary goal is to demonstrate how gradient descent can be applied to regression tasks in machine learning.  

## Dataset  

The dataset used for this project includes multiple features related to movies, including but not limited to:  

- Movie Title  
- Genre  
- Ratings   
- Budget
- Gross (target variable)  

Ensure to preprocess the dataset as required, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical features where necessary.  

## Requirements  

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:  

- numpy  
- pandas  
- math
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  

You can install the required packages using pip:
