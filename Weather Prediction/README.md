# Rain Tomorrow Prediction: Machine Learning Approaches  

## Overview  

This project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using a meteorological dataset. The prediction model is based on two popular machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees. The project demonstrates how different algorithms can be applied to solve the same classification problem and allows comparing their performance.  

## Dataset  

The dataset contains various meteorological features that may influence the prediction of rain. Key columns include:  

- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Pressure  
- Wind Speed  
- Rain Today (binary)  
- Rain Tomorrow (target variable) 


Please make sure to explore and preprocess the dataset to ensure the models perform optimally.
