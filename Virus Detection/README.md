# Virus Detection: Machine Learning Approaches  

## Overview  

This project focuses on detecting software viruses using machine learning techniques. The project employs two popular algorithms: Logistic Regression and Gaussian Naive Bayes, to classify samples as either benign or malicious based on various features extracted from them. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these classification algorithms in accurately identifying viruses.  

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to software files, along with a target variable indicating whether a file is a virus (OUTPUT column). 

## Requirements  

To run this project, the following Python packages are needed:  

- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib   
- seaborn  

You can install the required packages using pip:  

```bash  
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
